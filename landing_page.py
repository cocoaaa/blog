	Hello! 
	My name is Hae Jin (Hayley), and I'm currently a Master student at <a href="#">MIT EECS</a>
	(concentration: AI) under the joint	supervision of Professor. <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/">Regina Barzilay</a>, 
	Professor. <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/wojciech/">Wojciech Matusik</a>, and
	a Ph.D candidate, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jstraub/">Julian Straub</a>.
	
	Before my Masters, I studied Mathematics and EECS at MIT for my undergraduate studies.
	</p>

	I'm curious about what we call 'intelligence', especially the three-dimensional perception.
	<ul>
		<li>Recognition: What makes us recognize an object as what it is 
			(e.g. a bird as a bird, a bull as a bull)? 
			What is	the necessary and sufficient representation of an object for human recognition?  
			This question has been lingering on my mind ever since I saw a video of Picasso at work:

		<li>Understanding of the functional and causal relations between 
			objects in a visual scene
		</li>

		<li>Holistic scene interpretation by combining the semantical and geometric
		information from 2D images and 3D data (such as RGB-D)
		</li>
	</ul>
