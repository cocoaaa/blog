	Hello! 
	My name is Hae Jin (Hayley), and I'm currently a student at <a href="#">MIT EECS</a>
	(concentration: AI) pursuing a Masters in Engineering under the joint	supervision of 
        Professor. <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/">Regina Barzilay</a>, 
	Professor. <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/wojciech/">Wojciech Matusik</a>, and
	a Ph.D candidate, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jstraub/">Julian Straub</a>.
	
	Before my Masters, I studied Mathematics and EECS at MIT for my undergraduate studies.
	</p>

	<p>
	I'm curious about what we call 'intelligence', especially the three-dimensional perception.
	<ul>
		
                <li>Understanding of the functional and causal relations between 
			objects in a visual scene
		</li>

		<li>Holistic scene interpretation by combining the semantical and geometric
		information from 2D images and 3D data (such as RGB-D)
		</li>

                <li>Recognition: What makes us recognize an object as what it is 
			(e.g. a bird as a bird, a bull as a bull)? 
			What is	the necessary and sufficient representation of an object for human recognition?  
			This question has been lingering on my mind ever since I saw a video of Picasso at work:

        </p>

        <p>
        In a bigger scheme, I am excited about the problems regarding human perception of the world and
        how we can use our understandings to develop intelligent systems that can interactive with the 
        dynamic environments as we, humans, do.  
	I am interested how to combine the geometric understandings with the semanic interpretations of 
        a scene as the first step towards this goal.
        I mostly work in C++ and python on Linux-like environments.
        </p>

        <p>Besides working on my <a href="https://cocoaaa.github.io/blog/pages/publications/">projects</a>,
        I enjoy being in the nature and trying out different sports such as scuba diving and sky-diving..  
        I am happy when I'm biking, swimming, wandering  and sharing experiences with people I love. 
        </p>
